# AP Lab: Computer Science Principles

Points : 100

## Solution

We can deduce the following :

1. The input should be 18 characters long.
2. The output is "inagzgkpm)Wl&Tg&io".

Reversing the shift operations by flipping the '+' to '-' and vice versa gives us the flag.
Code in Reversing.java

Flag : `flag{intr0_t0_r3v}`
